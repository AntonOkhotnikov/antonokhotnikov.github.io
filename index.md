## Intro

Hey! I'm a proactive research engineer with 6+ years of experience in speech processing and with advanced leadership skills. I've got an extensive background of team management in a product-oriented R&D environment. I love being in *Day 1* mode and going beyond what is considered being SotA. My research interests also include multi-modal applications, recommender systems and generative models.
