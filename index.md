## Intro

Hey! I'm a proactive research engineer with 6+ years of experience in speech processing and strong leadership skills. I have extensive experience managing teams in a product-oriented R&D environment. I love being in *Day 1* mode and constantly pushing beyond the State of the Art. My research interests include multi-modal applications and generative modeling with speech.
